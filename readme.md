1) fork and `git clone`

2) `npm install`

3) run `npm test`

4) work through the models in db/models/students.js and db/models/tests.js *before* routes/students.js and routes/test.js

*tips*

- Make sure to look over `app.js` and have an understanding of existing middleware given and what else might be needed
- Change the `xit` to `it` in the test specs and work through them one by one
- Isolate `describe` blocks or `it` blocks of tests by changing it to `describe.only` or `it.only`

Good luck!
